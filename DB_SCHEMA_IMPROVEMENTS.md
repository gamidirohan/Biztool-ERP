# Database Schema Improvement Suggestions

This document lists recommended improvements for the current ERP/CRM database schema (`schema.sql`).

## 1. User-Defined Types
- Define all `USER-DEFINED` columns (e.g., contact type, order type/status, user role) as proper enums or custom types:
  ```sql
  CREATE TYPE contact_type AS ENUM (...);
  CREATE TYPE order_status AS ENUM (...);
  CREATE TYPE user_role AS ENUM (...);
  ```

## 2. Array Usage
- Clarify array columns (e.g., `tags ARRAY` in `contacts`). Prefer `text[]` or use a join table for tags to enable efficient querying and filtering.

## 3. Referential Integrity
- Review foreign key creation order to avoid circular dependencies. Ensure all referenced tables exist before applying constraints.

## 4. JSONB Fields
- Use `jsonb` fields (address, custom_fields, preferences) only for truly dynamic or flexible data. For frequently queried fields, consider normalization for better performance and indexing.

## 5. Audit & Soft Delete
- Consider adding a `deleted_at` column for soft deletes, allowing retention of deleted records for audit/history purposes.

## 6. Normalization & Partitioning
- Tables with high data volume (e.g., `attendance_records`) may benefit from partitioning or archiving strategies to maintain performance.

## 7. Currency & Numeric Types
- For monetary values (salary, unit_cost, selling_price), consider using `money` or `decimal(12,2)` for currency consistency and precision.

## 8. Multi-Tenancy
- Ensure all queries are scoped by `tenant_id` to maintain tenant isolation and prevent data leaks.

## 9. Default Values
- Double-check that all enum and status fields have valid default values matching their type definitions.

## 10. Indexes
- Add indexes on frequently queried foreign keys and unique fields (e.g., `employee_id`, `tenant_id`, `order_number`) to improve query performance.

## Summary
Your schema is well-structured for a modular ERP/CRM. Address the above points to further improve scalability, maintainability, and performance.
